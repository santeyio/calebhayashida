      Hey there! I'm Caleb Hayashida. The most important thing about me is that I'm a follower of Jesus. I'm a programmer and professional learner, and when I'm not programming for work or fun you'll most likely find me experimenting in the kitchen or writing, recording, and producing music. I also enjoy perfecting my tea brewing and appreciation skills, experiencing great beer and whiskey, traveling to new places and talking to interesting people. Of course I can't leave out my love of pipes, cigars, and reading: classical literature, philosophy, monastic literature, and fantasy (not an exhaustive list by any means).
